# SCP-CB_Text-Based-Game
A text-based adventure game inspired by SCP:Containment Breach game on SCP's Foundation universe

## The project

The project was an semester end exam project based on everything we have seen on Java : Associations, Inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces and tests.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a small adventure game in the style of Colossal Cave Adventure.

This game, created in the 70s, is considered the first interactive adventure game :
    the program describes a situation (i.e. by a text display) and the player indicates what he wants to do by entering some text.
    The program analyzes the sentence entered by the user and reacts by displaying the new situation, and so on.
    Colossal Cave Adventure takes place in a cave, but you can create and imagine your own universe.
    
## Our game

As a fan of SCP Foundation's universe, I instantly thought about one of its game SCP: CB where we play a man stuck in a big labyrinthine laboratory with dangerous creatures and make him leave the facility.
So the game is a Horror Survival and I wanted to remake this game.
For now, it is just a demo, a very short game and I hope one day have the time to expand it.

In our game, we awake in this laboratory, we heard screams and alarms, we know we have to run away. We will have to accomplish a few puzzles to find the last room.

## To play

In waiting for a release, you will have to install yourself the game.

In a linux terminal in the repertory with the Makefile and the folder, use "make all" then "make start" to start playing. You can also use "make clean" to clean .class files

Then you can type "help" to see available commands.

Good game!
